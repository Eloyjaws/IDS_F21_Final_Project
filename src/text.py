                    In this project, we aim to explore the topic of social connections along with the 
                    impacts and effects of internet usage. It has long been known that social well-being 
                    is essential for people’s mental and physical health. A prevalent feeling of 
                    loneliness can be immensely detrimental, affecting not only individuals’ mood but 
                    also the physiology at the cellular level.
