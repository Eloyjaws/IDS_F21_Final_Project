                    In this project, we aim to explore the topic of social connections along with the 
                    effects of internet usage. <br><br>
                    It has long been known that social well-being 
                    is essential for people’s mental and physical health. A prevalent feeling of 
                    loneliness can be immensely detrimental, affecting not only individuals’ mood but 
                    also the physiology at the cellular level. <br><br>
                    In the meantime, recent studies have estimated that the average American spends 
                    over seven hours looking at screen, and more than 2 hours are spent using social 
                    media. Social media and other internet functionalities have become one of the 
                    most important ways for us to maintain and expand our social connections.

                The adult development study at Harvard University is a longitudinal 
                research project that has been going on for 80 years. The study 
                tracks the life and health of 456 disadvantaged males growing up 
                in Boston from 1940 to 1945.<br><br>
                One of the most important observations is that good relationships 
                keep people happy and healthy. Watch Robert Waldinger, the current director
                of the study, vividly describe the significance of good social

        The positive effects of healthy social connection is eminently illustrated by the 
        cross-country survey conducted by the World Value Survey. In the 4th wave of the 
        survey study, participants were asked a series of questions regarding their values, 
        habits, and social/professional status.
        
        In a cross-country comparison carried out by 
        OurWorld, it examined the effect of frequency of social interactions on happiness and 
        found people who have more frequent social interactions are generally happier than 
        those who have rare social activities.

social_connections_blurb_three = """
        Aside from the effects on happiness, social interaction also has impacts on people’s 
        professional career. As shown in the visualization, as many as 91% of job seekers utilize 
        their social relationships with friends, relatives, trade unions, and so on to seek 
        employment. Although the survey was conducted in 2005, the high proportion of people relying 
        on social connections demonstrated the popularity of the method. 
        
        In another survey conducted 
        for job searches in the United States in 2015, more than 65% relies on close friends or 
        family, more than 50% uses their professional or work connections, and over 55% relies on 
        acquaintances or friends-of-friends. Despite “online resources and information” is now taking 
        the lead, the observation that social connections taking the next 3 major categories 
        demonstrates it is still the most important pillar for job search.

social_connections_blurb_four = """
        Social connections not only help people get employed but also have a healthy economic 
        impact called knowledge spillover, where individuals with different expertise and backgrounds 
        exchange information and ideas leading to innovation and productivity growth. 
        
        The concept of 
        knowledge spillover has been noted as one of the main reasons for the coupling of economic 
        growth and increasing urbanization, where more educated individuals are living in close 
        proximity with each other and free to socialize. As shown on the visualization, countries 
        such as South Korea’s increased urbanization throughout the 1970s and 1980s coincided with 
        its rapid productivity growth.

        By 2016, the young population featuring ages between 14 and 24 in European countries now spend
        a daily average of 3 - 6 hours on the internet with more than half of European countries spending
        a daily minimum of 4 hours hours. From the social media insight in the next section, we observe 
        more social media platforms have emerged by 2016 with also 8 billion monthly active users.
        We can safely conclude that the increased time spent on the internet is directly influenced 
        by the increase in MAUs of social media platforms. We should also note that increased social 
        media MAUs implies increase in social and human connections.

        To better understand the factors influencing the population of interner user per country, 
        we explored the countries' GNI per capita and internet users population over 4 years (2017 - 2021).
        We found a trend amongst the countries with 4 distinct buckets. The High income countries mostly 
        had 70% - 99% of their population using the internet, Middle income (upper and lower) countries
        had between 40% - 85% internet users of total popualation whilst Low income countries had 
        between 2% and 30% of their total population using the internet. We interpreted that GNI per 
        capita of countries have some role to play in accessibility and availability of internet 
        especially in low income countries. Due to the overlap in between the Upper-middle income 
        countries and some high income countries, we postulate that there are under factors that 
        influence internet availability and high number of internet users.

        are Isle of Man, Jersey, Ireland, Cayman Islands, and Grenada, while the US didn’t even make

        As previously mentioned, loneliness can be immensely detrimental to an individual’s 
        overall well-being. An argument has recently been made about an ongoing loneliness 
        pandemic, and we aim to gauge the situation in our following analysis.

        One of the major ways to examine the seriousness of an unhealthy mental state such 
        as loneliness is by using surveys. Our first dataset we explored the self-reported 
        loneliness among older individuals in a number of European countries and the US. 
        
        As shown in the visualization, the prevalence of loneliness varies significantly 
        among the surveyed countries: Denmark’s reported share of loneliness is as low as 
        25%, while the number in Greece reaches a staggering 62%. The wide gap also notes 
        that the problem of loneliness may not be solely tied to economic development since 
        all surveyed countries are developed economies. An elementary conclusion from the 
        above analysis is that the prevalence of loneliness is likely to be country and 
        culture specific.
    """

loneliness_friends_relative_blurb = """
        Besides the direct self-report provided above, we have also found tangential evidence 
        regarding loneliness. In a 2016 cross-country survey, participants were asked whether 
        they have close friends or relatives they can count on when participants are in need. 
        
        From a loneliness perspective, the question is effectively asking whether the participant 
        has strong social connections and is probably not lonely. As we can see from the map, 
        Ireland has the max share of 98.3% while South Korea has min share of 75.9%, and 
        both are developed countries. We can also observe that among developing countries, 
        South Africa has a decently high share of 88.3% and Mexico has a low share of 80.1%. 
        These observations further detach states of economic development from the loneliness problem.
    """

loneliness_single_person_household_impact_blurb_one = """
        Share of single-person households has been suggested as a factor related to loneliness. 
        To explore this problem, we combined data provided by OurWorld and WorldBank to generate 
        the visualization of GDP per capita vs Share of One-Person Households. 
        
        Since GDP per capita 
        for most countries grows as time progresses, the X-axis can also be viewed as an axis of time 
        (non-linear scale). Examining the trend over the world and for each continent, we can observe 
        that the share of single-person households grows as GDP per capita increases.
    """

loneliness_single_person_household_impact_blurb_two = """
        Does more single-person households lead to more feelings of loneliness? Based on our previous 
        analysis, economic states do not correlate well with the prevalence of loneliness, but there is 
        an obvious correlation between wealth and share of one person households. Denmark, whose elder 
        population reported the least share of loneliness, has as many as 45% of one-person households. 

        So our conclusion is that the direct correlation is difficult to draw between loneliness and 
        share of single-person households. For example, the rapid rise in single-person households may be 
        attributed to people being finally wealthy enough to live by themselves rather than living alone causes 
        loneliness (or vice versa). Also, it is worth pointing out that being alone and loneliness are two 
        different concepts, whose specific differences are out of the scope of this project.

        The more complex interaction among single-person household share, GDP per capita, sufficiency of 
        mental health facilities, and many more factors may be able to predict the level of loneliness for 
        any given entity using machine learning. However, we believe that our limited data is insufficient 
        to perform such analysis.
    """

loneliness_social_media_blurb = """
        There has been much debate about whether social media can counterintuitively lead to the problem of 
        loneliness. According to our research, a more appropriate question should be how much social media 
        usage leads to increased anxiety or feelings of loneliness/anxiety.

        OurWorld has performed analysis of data previously released by Moment, an app that allows users to 
        track their screen time with other apps. A quick glance at the visualization shows that happy users 
        generally spend less time on social media apps than unhappy users. Though this result does not 
        answer the debated question of whether social media causes loneliness, the conclusion is easy to 
        interpret: spending too much time on social media incurs diminishing (and even negative) return.
    """

Conclusion = """
        We have found social connection is vitally important to any individuals’ 
        health and wellness. Beyond an individual level, social connection contributes 
        to the productivity and economic development of its corresponding country or 
        political entity. On the other hand, loneliness, which is detrimental to individuals’ 
        health, appears to be related to culture and economic status.

        The rise of internet connection and subsequent rise of social media platforms 
        have affected the lives of the majority of the population throughout the world 
        and have changed the way people interact with each other. The effects are most 
        evident in the younger generation, who spend more time on digital devices.

        Despite the media buzz about the negative impact of social media on mental 
        health and loneliness, we have found the claim to be weakly supported. A more 
        profound and obvious impact is the extent to which social media has lowered 
        the cost of communication and enables easier maintenance of social relationships 
        across countries. The effects of social media are amplified by the Covid pandemic 
        that makes in-person social interaction more difficult than ever before.

        Social media has the potential to become an even bigger game changer to benefit 
        people’s social well-being, and we would like to call for platforms and users 
        alike to promote healthy habits of using social media.
