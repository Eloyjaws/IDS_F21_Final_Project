                    In this project, we aim to explore the topic of social connections along with the 
                    impacts and effects of internet usage. It has long been known that social well-being 
                    is essential for people’s mental and physical health. A prevalent feeling of 
                    loneliness can be immensely detrimental, affecting not only individuals’ mood but 
                    also the physiology at the cellular level.

                The adult development study at Harvard University is a longitudinal 
                research project that has been going on for 80 years. The study 
                tracks the life and health of 456 disadvantaged males growing up 
                in Boston from 1940 to 1945.<br>
                One of the most important observations is that good relationships 
                keep people happy and healthy. Watch Robert Waldinger, the current director
                of the study, vividly describe the significance of good social 
                connections in one of the most watched TED talks:

        The positive effects of healthy social connection is eminently illustrated by the 
        cross-country survey conducted by the World Value Survey. In the 4th wave of the 
        survey study, participants were asked a series of questions regarding their values, 
        habits, and social/professional status. In a cross-country comparison carried out by 
        OurWorld, it examined the effect of frequency of social interactions on happiness and 
        found people who have more frequent social interactions are generally happier than 
        those who have rare social activities.
        """

social_connections_paragraph_three = """
        Aside from the effects on happiness, social interaction also has impacts on people’s 
        professional career. As shown in the visualization, as many as 91% of job seekers utilize 
        their social relationships with friends, relatives, trade unions, and so on to seek 
        employment. Although the survey was conducted in 2005, the high proportion of people relying 
        on social connections demonstrated the popularity of the method. In another survey conducted 
        for job searches in the United States in 2015, more than 65% relies on close friends or 
        family, more than 50% uses their professional or work connections, and over 55% relies on 
        acquaintances or friends-of-friends. Despite “online resources and information” is now taking 
        the lead, the observation that social connections taking the next 3 major categories 
        demonstrates it is still the most important pillar for job search.

social_connections_paragraph_four = """
        Social connections not only help people get employed but also have a healthy economic 
        impact called knowledge spillover, where individuals with different expertise and backgrounds 
        exchange information and ideas leading to innovation and productivity growth. The concept of 
        knowledge spillover has been noted as one of the main reasons for the coupling of economic 
        growth and increasing urbanization, where more educated individuals are living in close 
        proximity with each other and free to socialize. As shown on the visualization, countries 
        such as South Korea’s increased urbanization throughout the 1970s and 1980s coincided with 
        its rapid productivity growth.
