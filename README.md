# IDS_F21
Interactive Data Science Project - Fall 2021
## Goals

The goal for this project was to present the importance of social connections and the rise of social media before identifying the impact of internet on social connections.

Several sources have shown that Billions of people are going online to stay in touch during the COVID-19 pandemic, but almost half of the worldâ€™s population has no access to the internet.

- This digital divide impacts women more than men.

- The internet is the answer to many of the problems during Covid19 lockdowns, but what about the unconnected billions?

To do this we first sought to answer several questions:
1. What are the top countries where social connections are healthiest?
2. What are the countries whose population spent most time online or on social media?
3. How important are social connections?
4. What are the share of population in each country that socialize using social media?
5. Does social media and other internet features affect our social connections? If so, how and how much?
6. What are some of the factors related to healthy/unhealthy social connection?
7. How much does social media affect someone's mental health and feelings of loneliness?

We performed some Exploratory Data Analysis to answer these initial questions but obtained more insights along the way. They are presented in our [Streamlit App](https://share.streamlit.io/)


## Design Decisions

### Datasets
We used a combination of multiple datasets:
- The Inclusive Internet Index, commissioned by Facebook and developed by The Economist Intelligence Unit, seeks to measure the extent to which the Internet is not only accessible and affordable, but also relevant to all, allowing usage that enables positive social and economic outcomes at the individual and group level.

- OWID, short for Our World in Data, is a project of the Global Change Data Lab based in UK. The project and, more specifically, its contents about social connections and loneliness give a good overview of the subject, while providing datasets and rudimentary visualizations.

- Facebook Social Connectedness Index, created by Facebook in an attempt to better understand the friendship established via Facebook across countries.
